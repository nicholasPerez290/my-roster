## How application works

* The application uses test based code
```
When the roster info is submitted it is combined into an array witch is then pulled apart and separated into three classes with a parent class of Employee and unique properties from each subclass. The test is used to insure each class and subclass returns the right value when each property is called.
```
* We use fs to then create the new HTML file generated from a template function
